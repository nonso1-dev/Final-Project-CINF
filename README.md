# Final-Project-CINF

## Overview
My final project is a Python-based data mining project designed to analyze CSV data under various parameters. Whether you're dealing with financial data, customer demographics, or sensor readings, DataMineCSV offers a robust toolkit for extracting insights and patterns from your datasets.

## Features
- CSV Data Analysis: Import CSV data and perform comprehensive analysis using a variety of data mining techniques.
- Parameter Evaluation: Evaluate the data under different parameters such as time series analysis, correlation analysis, and clustering.
- Customizable:Easily customize parameters and analysis methods to suit your specific dataset and analysis goals.
- Visualization: Generate insightful visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to better understand the data.
- Export Results: Export analysis results and visualizations in various formats for further processing or sharing.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataMineCSV.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DataMineCSV
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script and specify the CSV file and parameters to analyze:
   ```bash
   python data_mine.py --file data.csv --parameters parameter1 parameter2
   ```

## Example
```bash
python data_mine.py --file sales_data.csv --parameters time_series correlation clustering
```
